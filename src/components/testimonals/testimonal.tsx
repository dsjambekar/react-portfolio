					Amol saved us from a web disaster. I have had the pleasure
					of working with Amol when he was a developer in my agile
					scrumteam at ABN AMRO. As a developer he is capable of
					delivering IT solutions for the wishes of the business.
					Building/Coding conform standards while keeping in mind the
					future state architecture. He has a great knowledge of
					several programming languages, understands complex systems
					and keeps himself up to date about developments in the
					payments industry. The title of developer however does not
					do him justice as he is so much more than that. Amol is able
					to be a linking pin between business and the scrumteam to
					get requirements clear and to update both parties about the
					progress of the wishes and how they are going to be build.
					Thereby supporting and informing me as the productowner.
					Amol was the one in the scrumteam to make sure
					implementation of the wishes in production went according to
					plan by informing and discussing the upcoming
					implementations with functional maintenance and the release
					team. Last but not least he is an enjoyable person to work
					with. He is eager to learn and open for feedback. Amol
					appreciates a joke every now and then, but is serious about
					his work. A hard worker who likes to get things done on
					time.
